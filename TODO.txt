    I made this to log what we do and what I did with the html. So I noticed the data
    appears to be a dataset for the daily weather reportings for the city of Chicago, 
    so I named the site and headings accordingly. I also did all of the html because once
    I got the index done, it took about a minute to get the other pages up, and then also
    you guys don't have to try and fiddle with the foundation stuff because I don't even
    fully get it myself, but just now we have a consistent style. So in terms of what to do
    next, you can see that line 30 on the 3 html pages is the place where we would do the 
    string replacement to print out all of the data. I was thinking print the date with
    actual_mean_temp, actual_min_temp, and actual_max_temp for temperature. The date with
    average_min_temp, average_max_temp, record_min_temp, record_max_temp, record_min_temp_year,
    and record_max_temp_year for record. And the date with actual_precipitation, 
    average_precipitation, and record_precipitation for precipitation. So yeah if someone
    feels like doing that they can, if not we have the html done for Wednesday after class.

    there are some issues in the HTML file that I will fix with the css and tables, I implemented one of the dynamic tables for temperature
    and will do the rest of the tables

    Will add images and graphs to each page, work on previous and next buttons

3 Paths:
    1. All weather data by day 
    2. Min Temp, Max Temp, Avg Temp, Avg precipitation, total precipitation by month
    3. Min Temp, Max Temp, Avg Temp, Avg Precipitation, total precipitation by Season

    I did the html and css so now the only things we should have to do are, dynamically
    generate each url and fill in the header and data for the dynamically generated url, 
    fill in the href for the prev and next links, make at least one graph for at least 
    one of the three html files, and dynamically change the picture on the season page 
    for a picture of one of the 4 seasons. Also we have to send a propor 404 error when
    trying to access a page that doesnt exist.
